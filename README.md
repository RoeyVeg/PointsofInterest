A cool APP based on Google Place Search API, with the APP you can locate places to eat, hangout and other spots around your current location.
Read about the places, get reviews, contact details, see pictures, navigate with Google map and share with your friends
Supports both mobile and tablet

so go get your API key and put it in Java -> AdaptersNServices -> PlaceDetailsIntentService -> 
public static final String KEY = "Update your key here";
